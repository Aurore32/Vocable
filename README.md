Hi! :) 
Welcome to the repository for Vocable, a self-adaptive vocabulary quiz app developed and maintained by Turbo Huang (me)
For a demonstration of the app in action (not as exciting as it sounds), please go to the file "Vocable Demonstration" for sample images
For an example of the report generated for students upon quiz completion, please go to the file "Sample Report"
For the vocabulary question bank employed by the quiz, please visit "quiz_data.py"
(NOT RECOMMENDED) for an example of my... disorganized... coding skills (and the majority of the code that powers this app), please visit the python files contained within the repository
